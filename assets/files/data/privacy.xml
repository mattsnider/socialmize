		<title>godster Principles</title>
		<description><p>We built godster to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on godster; that is why we give you control of your information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your school, your specified local area, and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.</p><p>godster follows two core principles:</p><br><strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong></br><p>godster helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And you control with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the <link><title>My Privacy</title><url>/users/privacy/</url></link> page.</p><br><strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong></br><p>There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your friends, and people around you. We want to help you easily get that information.</p><p>Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please send them to <link><title>privacy@godster.com</title><url>mailto:privacy@godster.com</url></link>.</p></description>

		<title>The Information We Collect</title>
		<description><p>When you visit godster you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.</p><p>When you register with godster, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p><p>When you enter godster, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all godster visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to godster. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p><p>When you use godster, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p><p>If you post personally identifiable information in areas of the site accessible to other users, you should be aware that such information can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used improperly to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums or for others’ misuse of such information.

We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. godster stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <link><title>info@godster.com</title><url>mailto:info@godster.com</url></link> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p><p>godster may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the godster service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p><p>By using godster, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p></description>

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

		<title>Use of Information Obtained by godster</title>
		<description><p>When you register with godster, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on godster. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by godster that we think you may find valuable.</p><p>Profile information is used by godster primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other godster users may be able to supplement your profile.</p><p>Profile information you submit to godster will be available to users of godster who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends). Your name, school name, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the godster network unless you alter your privacy settings. This is primarily so your friends at other schools can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your school's network, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings.</p><p>godster will send you only service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.</p><p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p><p>godster may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people at a school like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you godster. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town. But we don't tell the movie company who you are.</p><p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services and other users of godster, to supplement your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p></description>

		<title>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</title>
		<description><p>We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p><ul><li>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about godster, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the godster-specified purposes.</li><li>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the godster world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</li><li>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the godster service or using the godster name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</li><li>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.</li><li>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on godster. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on godster, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</li><li>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the godster business, or individual business units owned by godster, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</li></ul></description>
